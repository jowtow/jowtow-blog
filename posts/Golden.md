Today, April 28th, 2025, is my birthday. Not only is it my birthday, it's actually my golden birthday! What is a golden birthday? I guess it's when the day of the month of your birth aligns with the age you are turning... but that definition wasn't cutting it for me, I wanted something special ðŸŽ‰ And this is what I came up with

## Background

We all know times ebb and flow between hard, less hard, good, bad, stressful. Well let's just say that coming into 2025, I've been determined to make it a good year. To quote my boy Kevin,
![Kevin Malone - It's just nice to win one](/blogphotos/kevin_malone.gif)

I started messing around in GarageBand on my MacBook, not too long ago, and started to really have fun. I have done music stuff in the past, but to be honest with you, I'm really not all that skilled when it comes to keeping time, site reading, and other actual musical skill stuff. I typically end up depending on my vocal chords (which as of late haven't been seeing much use) and my Jack Black-esque charm to get through. GarageBand is different though, it gave even someone as illiterate as me the power to make some sweet beats ðŸ”Š

After a little bit of messing around, I came up with the idea. I will write a fun, goofy song for my birthday, that also slaps. I will also film an equally as silly music video to accompany it... _and it was on_.

## Filming

If you are reading this and still haven't seen the music video, you gotta stop right now and go watch it!

Filming took a while, but I had a fantastic film crew and some lovely folks who were willing to help. #1 best film crew member (and only film crew member) is my sweet wife Brooke. She did such a great job filming and was so supportive of me the whole way. We had an absolute blast and I'm pretty sure both of us have decided this won't be the last music video / song we work on together ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤ðŸ˜¤. We filmed over the course of 3 weekends and it took time, there were various wardrobe changes, certain props that took time to find or otherwise create, and lots of laughs and extra takes along the way.

Anyone who witnessed us filming this probably either laughed a lot or considered calling the cops ðŸ¤£

## Lyrics

The lyrics might have been the most fun and easiest-for-me part of the song. I was inspired by a group I've been listening to called Joey Valance & Brae. Listen to a few of their songs and you'll be ready to lay down bars. Here they are for reference purposes.

```
I'm gold like rold and I twist like a pretzel
Breaking the mold and snapping the stencil
This free form, paint brush, no pencil
Slurpin on my soup, don't need a utensil

If I say it ,you know that I'm right
Your gold is fake like pyrite
When I ain't talking gold I'm talking chartreuse
I'll cut your head off like a Canada goose

Double Dash with me, and there won't be a truce
I'll drop a green shell, and chuck up the deuce
Smash the question block, get 3 mushrooms
Scratch that it was a golden mushroom!

Balling on you,  old school like spalding
Only 28 and I'm already balding
Only 28 and I'm covered in gold
Ice in my veins so you know that I'm cold

got a 28 carrot watch on me
'cause I bought 28 carrots at the Aldi
it cost me 25 cents To get a cart
then I copped a new fit over at the Walmart

Kettle Korn is a most delicious treat
I'll share it with you if you share it with me
treat others like you want to be treated fool
That's what jowtow calls the golden rule

If you try and find me, good luck I got stealth
The little things in life are the secret to wealth
When I'm talking wealth, I'm not talking coin
I'm talkin' sunsets and top sirloin

catch me on the block, in my fit-over shades
swamp people catchin' crocs, in the everglades
I don't like gators, not even a little bit
Ooh he's a big one, choot em elizabeth!

Cruisin' in my wagon, big diesel on fire
Looks like a work of art, no easel required
In my Phil Collins mode, no jacket required
Pops loves that guy and he just retired

But I'm not retired, I gotta keep going
Impossible to stop when these rhymes keep flowin
Until the next time you can catch me on my mobile
jowtow is golden and we're absolutely global
```

## Synopsis

Working on this project was super fun and I hope to do it again. Do me a favor and share it with someone you love, maybe they'll get a laugh out of it. Or share it with someone you really don't like, it might serve as a punishment of sorts ðŸ¤£
